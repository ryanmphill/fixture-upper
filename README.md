# Fixture Upper

[Visit Application Site](https://fixture-upper.netlify.app/)

This application allows you to convert data in the standard JSON format to JSON fixtures that can be used to seed databases connected to a Django project.  This is expecially useful if you have been using the JSON-server mock api with dummy data inside of .json files while developing a client, and you now want to work with that data as you build out the back end with Django.
